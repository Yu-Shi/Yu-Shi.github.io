I am a Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. I am supervised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/index.html) and affiliated with the [THUNLP Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interests lie within the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.

I received my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in Jun. 2021.
